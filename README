1 - About
---------

DreamChess is a user interface for playing chess. It comes with its own
engine called Dreamer. Both DreamChess and Dreamer are compatible with the
xboard/Winboard chess engine communication protocol. This means that
DreamChess can be used with other xboard-compatible chess engines such as
crafty (ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt/) and GNU Chess
(http://www.gnu.org/software/chess/). Similarly, the Dreamer chess engine can
be used with other xboard-compatible user interfaces such as xboard and
Winboard (http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html) and recent editions of the
commercial chess program Chessmaster (http://www.chessmaster.com/).
