*** 2014-??-?? - DreamChess v0.2.1 ***

2013 marked the 10-year anniversary of DreamChess. While we haven't been able
to spend a lot of time on the project in recent years, we have decided to
do a maintenance release to fix some of the issues that have been reported.

Most important changes:
- Fixed issue with chess piece selection on some AMD GPUs
- Fixed issue with rotating chess board on some Linux machines
- Fixed issue with changing resolution on some operating systems
- DreamChess no longer auto-exits when audio fails to open
- Board is automatically flipped when playing with black
- Pondering support in Dreamer chess engine
- Now supports building with mxml > 2.2
- New icon
- Music pack support on OS X

*** 2007-11-17 - DreamChess v0.2.0 ***

Over a year has passed since the first release, and we are now happy to
present DreamChess v0.2.0. DreamChess is a 3D chess game for Windows, Mac OS X
and Linux. The new release can be downloaded from our website at
http://www.dreamchess.org.

The main new feature is sound support. Matthew P. Smith was kind of enough to
allow us to use some of his songs in the game. The music pack containing these
songs is available for download from our website.

Graphically the game has been improved significantly. This was made possible
by the decision to drop the Dreamcast port (see below). The old 3D models have
been replaced by new models with a lot more detail. Other improvements include
reflections, hardware lighting, new textures, and a new sketch theme by
Annie Kirkpatrick.

The GUI has seen many small improvements, such as additional options that
could previously only be set from the command line. A new feature is the
"easy mode" (for those who felt that our engine Dreamer put up too much of a
fight even on Level 1).

DreamChess is now also available for Mac OS X by courtesy of Lawrence Sebald.
Unfortunately, we were forced to drop support for Dreamcast and BeOS. If
you're interested in picking up these ports, please send an email to
feedback at dreamchess.org.

We hope you enjoy this new release!
